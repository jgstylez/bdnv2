# BDN 2.0 Development Rules

## Routing Convention

**IMPORTANT**: All new pages MUST be placed in `app/pages/` directory, NOT in `app/(tabs)/`.

- Core tab navigation (Dashboard, Shop, Pay, Account) stays in `app/(tabs)/`
- All other pages go in `app/(tabs)/pages/`:
  - Business detail pages: `app/pages/businesses/[id].tsx`
  - Search pages: `app/pages/search/*`
  - Merchant pages: `app/pages/merchant/*`
  - MyImpact pages: `app/pages/myimpact/*`
  - University pages: `app/pages/university/*`
  - Media pages: `app/pages/media/*`
  - Enrollment pages: `app/pages/enroll-*.tsx`
  - Token pages: `app/pages/tokens.tsx`
  - Referral pages: `app/pages/referrals.tsx`
  - Admin pages: `app/admin/*`

## File Organization

- Keep files under 400 lines of code (LOC) when possible
- Refactor into smaller components when needed
- Place documentation in `action_plans/` folder

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing dark theme (#232323, #474747, #ba9988)
- Use flat vector iconography (@expo/vector-icons)
- Mobile-first responsive design
